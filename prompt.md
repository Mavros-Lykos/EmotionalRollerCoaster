i have a game idea, here is it which is the player is going through some events in the day. he is a university student at the time. and he is going through events on the day which affects the overall result of the day and his life. every decision he takes. matter. point is to make the decisions in between every emotion. like sad and  extreme happiness, like anger and extreme kindness. here extreme mean even the extremeness of good emotions not suitble for life. like extreme happiness will make you poor in money as you pay for unnecessary stuffs. and extreme kindness make you unsuitable for survival as when there is a situation you should be careful about your surivive if you care about others survive in a food shortage like situation you should have enough foods for you before giving them to otheres. if you did give your food, you will die without food. like that . this is the main logic in the game. to find the balance in life. player should understand this. to find the balance in the game. the theme is balance. right. so here create 5 events and for each occasion create 5 options to selects. in each option it will collect points. mean plus point of kindness, plus points for jeolus like wise focus on 5 emotions . at the end player should have minimum points for plus good emotions(+1 or 0) and 0 negative emotions. so at the end those points should be calculate. if not he should have each unique consequance showing at the end. like for + jeolous should show a die bieng a karen at the old age with a heartatache seeing neighbour bought a lamborghini. so choose what emotions should have here. chose events he would meet like he meet a burglur when he goes to the bus station. so he couls either give all of money carrying, leave him alone, give him money he can give, give him his lunch. like so if he gave him  allo of money +2 points of kindness. and he had to go to university and come by foot. extreme emotions should give +2 points. normal +1 which is suitable. vice versa for negtive emotions tooo.. at the end he shouldnt have any negative points and any extreme points to win and survive the life. did you get what i mean? before proceeding please let me know what do you want any other info.
